His interest in telegraphs helped him invent a transmitter to improve telephone communication, and his fascination with electricity led to the invention of the lightbulb--and networks of devices to send electricity throughout New York City. More than 1,000 of Edison's inventions, including the movie camera, movie projector, copy machine, and phonograph, have made our world a safer, brighter, and better place.</p>",

What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage--not by guns or bombs--but by a code so complex that if released would cripple U.S. intelligence. Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.",

He says the revelations about Jesus &mdash; not to be revealed here &mdash; have been whispered about for centuries, but have never overcome the opposition of organized Christianity.
